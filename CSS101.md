# CSS 101

CSS stands for **Cascading Style Sheets**, CSS is the "proper" way to control the appearence of your web pages.

## Linking a CSS Stylesheet to an HTML Document

Stylesheets are often kept in seperate documents to simplify the maintenence of a web site â€“ for sites with a single page, this doesn't matter much, but for sites with dozens of files it really helps.

In the ```<head>``` section of your HTML document include a ```<link>``` tag that looks like this:

    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="the_name_of_your_file.css">

A common name for the CSS file is the name of the project.

## CSS Syntax

CSS files consist of **selectors** and **declarations**.

In their simplest form selectors are the names of the HTML elements that your wish to style. The declarations consist of **properties** and their associated **values.**

Here is an example:

    h1 {
    	color: blue;
    	font-size: 20px;
    }

In this example ```h1``` is the selector. There are two declarations, one for property ```color``` and one for the property```font-size```. the value of color is ```blue```, for font-size it is ```20px```.

### Linking CSS and HTML

CSS uses **selectors** to identify the HTML that will be styled. The simplest selector is the name of an HTML tag, for example h1. Done like this the declaration applies to **all** h1 tags in the document.
